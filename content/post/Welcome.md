### There are many ways to keep up to date on Cloud Foundry: 

{{< figure src="/images/tony_info_radiator.jpg" class="left small" >}}

* The [POV Blog](http://blog.pivotal.io/) gives insight into our market and products;
* [This Week in Cloud Foundry](http://www.thisweekincf.com/) provides an update on development progress and CF specific news and events;
* The underground stylings of [Cloud Foundry After Dark](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFAD?src=hash) provide high-level thought leadership and vision.

But, until now, we've lacked an engineering focused forum by the Pivots on the ground. A place where the Pivotal engineers working in the Cloud Foundry trenches can tell their war stories and discuss strategies and tactics.

### Welcome to Fulcrum

{{< figure src="/images/discussion.jpg" class="right small" >}}

Why "Fulcrum?"  Placing a fulcrum in the right place allows someone small to move something massive.  This speaks both to the tools we build, and the culture we believe in. 
Our products allow massive organizations to be changed by small and passionate small teams.  The pivotal culture that produced these tools is about brains over brawn and teamwork over heroes.  As our founder recently said:

> We are a special company, defined by our special culture. While others in Silicon Valley chase individual accolades and hacker stereotypes, Pivotalâ€™s culture dictates that together we can make the once impossible probable. We do it by being kind to one another. Giving more than we expect to receive. Standing up and sharing, everyday. In sum, for us, software is a team sport.  -- Rob Mee

Cloud Foundry is built with Go, agile practices, and elbow grease.  We sling YAML, tame BOSH, and craft APIs.  We pair-program, test-drive, and ping-pong.  We standup, retro, and iterate.

If you're interested in these topics, then keep an eye on this space.  We'll be using this as a home for writing about all of this and more.
