There are many ways to keep up to date on Cloud Foundry: 

{{< figure src="/images/tony_info_radiator.jpg" class="right small" >}}

* The [POV Blog](http://blog.pivotal.io/) gives insight into our market and products;
* [This Week in Cloud Foundry](http://www.thisweekincf.com/) provides an update on development progress and CF specific news and events;
* The underground stylings of [Cloud Foundry After Dark](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFAD?src=hash) provide high-level thought leadership and vision.

But what we haven't had, until now, is a forum by coders, for coders.  A place where the Pivotal engineers working in the Cloud Foundry trenches can tell their war stories and discuss tactics.

### **THIS ENDS HERE AND NOW.**

Cloud Foundry is built with Go, agile practices, and elbow grease.  We sling YAML, tame BOSH, and craft APIs.  We pair-program, test-drive, and ping-pong.  We standup, retro, and "feel."

We'll be using this as a home for writing about all of those things and more.
