  Technical details for how we implemented containers on Windows 2016 Server Core for Pivotal
  Cloud Foundry.
title: "Implementing Windows Server Containers for Cloud Foundry : A Deep Dive"
---

Hey, have you heard? Recently, Pivotal Cloud Foundry supports running
applications in [Windows Server Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/).
This post is meant to be an update to our previous deep dive for how [containers worked on Windows 2012R2](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/windows-containerization-deep-dive/).

Garden-runC Release and windows
-------------------------
Previously, for applications running on Windows2012R2 stack, garden-windows team implemented [garden API](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/garden) and
maintained [garden-windows-bosh-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-windows-bosh-release).
Currently, windows2016 implementation has taken
advantage of pluggable nature of [Guardian](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/guardian)
and only implements the Runtime, Network, and Image plugins for windows2016.
- [__winc__](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/winc): This is the
OCI Runtime Plugin for creating and running containers in windows2016 stack.
- [__winc-network__](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/winc): This is the
Nework Plugin for [Guardian](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/guardian).
- [__groot-windows__](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/groot-windows): This is the
Image Plugin for managing container images and setting up a root filesystem. This plugin can be used with local OCI image or remote Docker URIs.

Windows Container Isolation
---------------------------

Windows Server 2016 is shipped with Windows Server Containers, similar to the primitives
found in the Linux kernel. We use the official [hcsshim](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim)
Go library for instrumenting the Windows Server Containers in Cloud Foundry.
Windows Server Container provide application isolation through process and namespace isolation technology.
A Windows Server container shares a kernel with the container host and all containers running on the host.

Here are some of the details on how Garden-Windows secures applications:

* __Filesystem isolation__: Windows Server Containers now by
default use a temporary scratch space on the container host's system drive for storage
during the lifetime of the container. This allows us to have a dedicated file system
(e.g. Access to `C:\`) inside of the container. Any modifications made to the
container file system or registry is captured in a sandbox managed by the host.
As a result, we are now able to create and maintain a root file system (rootfs) that allows
applications to receive security upgrades when running on the platform.

* __Disk usage__: Disk usage limits are enforced by NTFS [disk
  quotas](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938945.aspx#XSLTsection128121120120)
  in both Window2012R2 and Window2016 stack.
  Previously, this quota applied to all files owned by a given user, but with Windows Server Containers
  the quota is now applied to the Sandbox image.

* __Network isolation__: Windows Server Containers each have a network compartment
which is analogous to how the Linux containers work.

* __Memory usage__:  TODO
* __CPU usage__: TODO

We at Pivotal believe that .NET is an important enterprise platform and are
committed to the success of the project. Weâ€™re also excited about future
opportunities for .NET on Cloud Foundry, including .NET Core and our [Steel
Toe](http://steeltoe.io/) initiative. The user experience and adding new features
is so much better compared to our support for Windows 2012R2.

We hope that this serves as a good introduction to containers as they have been
implemented on Windows 2016. Our team is always available on
[Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/garden-windows/) to answer any
questions you may have.
