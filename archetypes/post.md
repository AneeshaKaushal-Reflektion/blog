# Header 1 

Don't use this, since it looks like a main title.

## Writing a _Good_ Post

_copied from [the README](https://github.com/pivotal/blog#writing-a-good-post)..._

**Keep it technical.**  People want to to be educated and enlightened.  Our audience are engineers, so the way to reach them is through code.  The more code samples, the better.

**Nobody likes a wall of text.**  Use headers to break up your text.  Each image you add to your post increases its XP by 100.  Diagrams, screen shots, or humorous "meme" (_|memƒÅ|_) gifs...  They all add color.  If you don't have OmniGraffle, then submit an ask ticket.  There's no excuse for monotony.

**Your 10th grade teacher was right.**  Make use of the hamburger technique.  Your audience doesn't have a lot of time.  Tell them what you're going to write, write it, and then tell them what you've written.  Spend time on your opening.  Make it click.

**Pair all the time.**  We do everything as a team, and this is no different.  Get feedback from your friends and coworkers.  Show them the post on the staging site, and ask them to tear it apart.

**Make it pretty.** Pivotal-ui comes with a bunch of nice helpers.  Make use of them.  Check out the example styles below:
